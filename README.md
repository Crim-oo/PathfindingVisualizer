# PathfindingVisualizer
A simple web application that allows you to show and visualize how different pathfinding algorithms work.

## Technologies Used
- React

## Algorithms Used

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (unweighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search** (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Crim-oo/PathfindingVisualizer.git
    ```

2. Set up the `client`

    Install the required dependencies:

     ```bash
    cd client/ && npm i 
    ```
    
3. Run the `application`
    
    Enter this command on the folder "client" of the project.
    
    ```bash
    npm start 
    ```
